## Exercise

Now that we've seen both ARIMA and SARIMA models, let's identify the parameters for a dataset of XXX and see how our key performance metrics change.

The dataset X has been preloaded, and from our previous exercises, remember that we fit an ARIMA (1,1,0) model to this dataset.

## Instructions

  * Investigate the ACF/PCF of X and observe the 4 week seasonality.
  * Define the seasonal_difference_4 series and determine seasonal parameters from it's ACF/PCF.
  * Inspect the performance of this SARIMAX (1,1,0)x(0,1,1,4) model, and compare to the ARIMA (1,1,0).
  * Plot forecasts from your new SARIMAX model with confidence intervals.

## Code

```(python)
